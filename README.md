*Because life's too short for bad book choices.*

Ever started a book only to realize 50 pages in that it's not for you? Yeah, me too. That's why I built ReadSync - to help you discover your next favorite read before you commit.

## What does it do?

ReadSync is an Android app that gives you AI-powered book summaries so you can decide what's worth your time. Think of it as your reading buddy who's already read everything and gives you the honest scoop.

**The basics:**
- Search through millions of books (thanks, Open Library!)
- Get smart summaries powered by Google's Gemini AI
- Save summaries offline for your commute
- Clean, fast interface that doesn't get in your way

## Why I built this

I'm a developer who loves reading but hates wasting time on books that don't click. After trying various book apps that were either too cluttered or missing key features, I decided to build something simple and focused.

Plus, I wanted to experiment with Jetpack Compose and AI integration - this seemed like the perfect playground.

## Tech stuff (for the curious)

- **Built with:** Kotlin & Jetpack Compose
- **Architecture:** MVVM (because it just works)
- **APIs:** Open Library for book data, Gemini for summaries
- **Storage:** Room database with smart caching
- **State management:** StateFlow (goodbye, LiveData headaches)

The app follows clean architecture principles because maintainable code is happy code.

## Current status

üöß **Work in progress!** 

Right now you can:
- [x] Search and browse books
- [x] Get AI summaries
- [x] Cache everything locally

Coming soon:
- [ ] User accounts and sync
- [ ] Reading lists and favorites  
- [ ] Better search filters
- [ ] Dark mode (I know, I know...)
- [ ] smooth animations (because why not?)

## Want to help?

This started as a personal project, but I'd love to make it better with your help! Whether you're:

- A developer who wants to contribute code
- A designer with UI/UX ideas
- A reader with feature suggestions
- Someone who just wants to report bugs

All contributions are welcome. Check out the issues tab or just fork and submit a PR.

**What I'm looking for help with:**
- Making the UI even more intuitive
- Optimizing API calls and caching
- Adding accessibility features
- Writing better documentation (this README could probably use work too)

## Running it locally

1. Clone this repo
2. Get a Gemini API key from Google
3. Add it to your `local.properties` file
4. Hit run in Android Studio

That's it. No complex setup, no weird dependencies.

## A note on AI summaries

The summaries are generated by AI, so they're not perfect. They're meant to give you a quick sense of what a book is about, not replace actually reading it. Think of them as really smart book blurbs.

## License

MIT License - use it, modify it, learn from it. Just don't blame me if you get addicted to reading more books than you have time for.

*Built by a developer who reads too much and codes even more.*

**Star this if you find it useful** ‚≠ê (or if you just want to make me happy)
